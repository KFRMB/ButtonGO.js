<b> Using jQuery </b>

In order to make my page load faster and avoid lagg in my animations i used jQuery. 
This library also gives me the option to make DOM manipulation easier.
In order to use jQuery add the following line to your index.html:

> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js">

id="buttonGOdown"

id="buttonGOup"

id="buttonGOleft"
